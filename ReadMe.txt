This project measures, and plots EOG signals as the person reads a paragrpah. Each line has approzimately 7 words and the person eyes move to the next line to read there.
The project filters to obtain a clear signal and then measures peaks as saccades as eye traverses each word. These are paused by periods of fixation. The new line shows a great movement in the EOG signal to mark a new line being read.
